- Whomsoever holds this hammer, if he be worthy, shall possess the power of Thor! -

#Description
===========
#This is a recreation of the Thor mod by OminousVoice. Without his marvellous work this would not have been possible.
Acquiring the armour
====================
Head up the 7000 steps toward High Hrothgar. Near where the troll attacks you find a chest. In it there will be 10 Aetherium ingots, 10 void salts and a book called 'If He Be Worthy'. Read the book to gain the Heart of Thunder perk, two spells and instructions on forging the armour and hammer. As with the original Heart of Thunder will need to be level 50 in Smithing and have the Heart of Thunder perk to craft the gear. All weapons and armour must be crafted at the Skyforge.

The armour cuirass has two variants; Heavy and sleeveless Light. Mjollnir also comes in an unenchanted version as well.

#Incompatibility
===============
Currently incompatible with SkyRe. 
It is not reccommended to to use this alongside the original Heart of Thunder due to conflicts.

#Known Issues or Bugs
====================
Sometimes the book may not grant you the perk. To remedy this simply unpack the scripts from the BSA and install them directly into your Skyrim/Data/Scripts directory.

#Licensing/Legal
===============
You can do whatever you want with this mod but all I ask in return is that
you give me and Ominous Voice credit if you distribute any part of this mod.
